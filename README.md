# Data-Science-Club---SU
Activities and Projects for our club here at Syracuse University

Last year was the first time i was introduced to data science. I immediately felt some kind of passion in myself for the field.
I did not know how to code. But over the next 6 months I decided to learn on my own explore more resources. I still am a beginner in this field

I became a part of Data science club here at SU and wanted to learn something and it helped me. I wanted to build on that and even imrpove that 
I decided to change that. I applied to become the President of the club with a vision of helping students to take the initial leap

We at Data science club want to give the members the needed push to go out and explore the world of data science.

The Mission for our club is to 'Create a community of data minded people to help each other and foster growth in the field of Data Science'
The club is open to everyone who is new or has some knowledge in the field.

Through this respository, I want to share what has been covered in the clubs meetings.
We hope to start competing in competitions by next semester together as a club.
